					<h3>About this practice</h3>
					<p>Learn how we help clients build capabilities and capture new opportunities while addressing
						powerful forces reshaping the chemicals industry.

						Powerful forces are reshaping the chemicals industry, and as a result, the formula for success
						in its markets. In response to the global economic slowdown, volatile energy prices, and a
						general economic shift toward the east, new chemicals players must build capabilities and
						incumbents must sharpen their value propositions—and players across the industry must expand
						into new products and geographies. Our industry experience and global reach make us uniquely
						positioned to help our clients address these evolving challenges—and capture new opportunities.
					</p>
					<h3>What we do</h3>
					<p>We have served the majority of global leaders in the chemicals industry, as well as midsized
						organizations, start-ups, and leading private equity companies. We have a global perspective on
						the chemicals industry's challenges and opportunities—and how they differ in emerging and mature
						markets. We offer strategic advice on topics across the value chain, including corporate and
						business-unit strategy, organization, post-merger management, growth, innovation, performance
						management, and all aspects of operational improvement.

						We combine our experience in functional topics with our expertise in the following materials:

						basic inorganic chemicals such as olefins, aromatics, and chlor-alkali
						polymers, including thermoplastics, elastomers, and synthetic fibers
						specialty and formulated chemicals, including pharmaceutical and food ingredients, electronic
						chemicals, water-treatment chemicals, and adhesives and sealants
						advanced materials such as composites and ceramics
						agricultural inputs such as crop protection, fertilizers, and seeds; as well as products along
						the entire agriculture value-chain
						cement

						<li>part of our suite of proprietary benchmarking tools, Innomatics helps clients compare their innovation performance against their peers, while M&S Matics benchmarks their marketing and sales function</li>
						<li>Periscope, one of the many tools we use to help clients increase their profitability, works to create better pricing</li>
