					<h2>Healthcare</h2>
					<p>We are dedicated to improving healthcare for the communities that our clients serve—this has long
						been part of our stated mission.

						Healthcare improvements have dramatically increased life expectancy, and new treatments are
						improving quality of life for many populations. Yet with this progress comes daunting economic
						challenges. For at least 40 years, healthcare spending has outpaced GDP growth by some two
						percentage points in most developed countries. Across publicly and privately financed healthcare
						systems, escalating spending has crowded out investments in education and social services,
						eroded growth in personal incomes, and reduced returns on invested capital in many regions.

						Most governments and healthcare industry leaders understand that spending increases cannot
						continue indefinitely and are looking for ways to drive innovation and efficiencies while
						improving health. That’s where we come in.</p>

					<h3>Who we are</h3>
					<p>We work with private and public healthcare leaders to identify innovative ways to tackle today’s
						biggest healthcare challenges. We are at the forefront of making healthcare better, more
						affordable, and more accessible for millions of people around the world. Our impact spans the
						globe and some examples include:

						Improved the affordability of healthcare by eliminating over $13 billion of waste and
						inefficiency globally in 2018 alone
						Supported public programs and private insurers to expand health insurance coverage to nearly two
						million people in the United States, as well as in Europe and Asia–Pacific
						Cut emergency room wait times by as much as two hours, reduced ambulance diversion due to ER
						congestion by up to 80 percent in hospitals across 15 US states
						Developed new product design capabilities for med-tech companies in hospital markets in
						Southeast Asia and co-developed a newborn monitoring device that will save the lives of
						thousands of newborn babies
						Implemented outcomes-based payment for maternity services, improving prenatal care for over
						400,000 pregnant women globally
						Established an innovative partnership between a supermarket chain and health insurer in Europe,
						leading to improved staff health and a reduction in illness costs
						Boosted care quality and efficiency for over five million individuals with asthma and other
						respiratory illnesses, as well as improving the management of care for 750,000 individuals with
						long term conditions in Europe
						Deployed advanced analytics, digital, and design-thinking to transform Nigeria’s vaccine supply
						chain, delivering 30 percent improvement in baseline performance and developed an emergency
						operations center to help reduce polio disease levels by 99 percent

						Our approach is highly collaborative: from supporting government agencies with technical
						analysis, as they set priorities, to working with clinicians—for example, to increase nurse
						satisfaction and reduce turnover. We work hand in hand with clients to help deliver measurable
						impact and build their capabilities.</p>
					<h3>What we do</h3>
					<p>We bring a global perspective and deep understanding of how healthcare works, with the experience
						to counsel senior healthcare stakeholders, plus the size and scale that ensures real expertise
						across the landscape.

						Our team comprises more than 1,700 consultants worldwide—including over 160 physicians, nurses,
						social workers, pharmacists, and other clinicians. Over 250 actuaries, data scientists, and
						analysts apply advanced analytics to financial, clinical, and socio-economic data, while more
						than 100 engineers and design professionals build and deploy digital solutions.

						our consultants speak over 100 languages and have supported clients in 70-plus
						countries. Nearly half of our consultants, analysts, and engineers (including our partners) are
						women..</p>
