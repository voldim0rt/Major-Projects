					<h2>Real Estate</h2>
					<p>Enabling clients to cultivate greater economic and societal returns in the built environment
						Real estate is fundamental to the human experience. It’s where the world spends 90 percent of its time living, working, shopping, and playing. But society’s needs, expectations, and wants of real estate have permanently evolved, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and increasing economic uncertainty.
